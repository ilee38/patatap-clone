Play cool sounds and animations on your browser using your keyboard!

Inspired in www.patatap.com, this app uses a HTML5 Canvas to draw animated circles while playing a sound with each key stroke of the keyboard (only letter keys).

The app uses Paperjs (paperjs.org) for graphics and howler.js (howlerjs.com) for sounds.

Simple, but strangely satisfying.
